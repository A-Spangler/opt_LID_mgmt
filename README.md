# Basic Overview

  The Optimal-Equitable-LID-Mgt repository contains python code that was developed at the University of Virginia and parallelized to run on linux clusters using an open-source tool that manages jobs called Slurm. The code was developed to explore the impacts of integrating a social equity objective into a low impact development (LID) optimization model and to explore the potential tradeoffs and synergies between near Pareto-optimal solutions under different formulations. We use the Borg python wrapper to implement the Borg multi-objective evolutionary algorithm within our SWMM model. Python libaries included in the python files must be installed and Borg must be compiled before running the code found in the "LID_Optimization_Code" folder.
