# Basic Overview

  The Optimal-Equitable-LID-Mgt repository contains python code that was developed at the University of Virginia and parallelized to run on linux clusters using an open-source tool called Slurm. Please see the University of Virginia High Performance Computing website to learn more about how parallel code is executed using Slurm at URL: https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/rivanna/slurm/. The code was developed to explore the impacts of integrating a social equity objective into a low impact development (LID) optimization model and to explore the potential tradeoffs and synergies between near Pareto-optimal solutions under different formulations. We use the Borg python wrapper to implement the Borg multi-objective evolutionary algorithm within our SWMM model. Python libaries included in the python files must be installed and Borg must be compiled before running the code found in the "LID_Optimization_Code" folder. You can visit the Borg website at URL: http://borgmoea.org/ for more information on how to use Borg.
